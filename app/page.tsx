          <p>It starts with wind. The kind that erases small talk and leaves only the bones of a sentence. In Iceland, edges feel closer, light feels cleaner, and silence has its own weather.</p>
          <p>Water speaks first. It falls like glass, then drifts as mist, then returns as a soft chill on the skin. On black sand, the Atlantic writes and rewrites its short poems, white ink on obsidian.</p>

          <p>Between geyser breath and quiet roads, the mind slows. You start noticing small things: a single red roof in a valley, steam threading through rain, the way lava keeps its memory even after it cools.</p>
          <p>Iâ€™ll return with warmer gloves. Until then, these frames will have to hold the weather.</p>
